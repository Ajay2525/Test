git process to add file to remote github 
=======================================
go to folder
git init
git add <filename>.csv/txt -- stage area -- prepare file
git commit -m" write comments" -- commit the change (save the entry locally)

git remote add origin <github path of repo> -- here origin is github path 

git push origin main -- here file is pushed to origin from main branch(origin -- github path , main -- file branch)

==========================
echo "file content will write here " > filename.txt
===========================

git fetch → bring changes from GitHub to your computer.

git merge → combine GitHub’s history with your local commits.

rebase = make your commits sit on top of GitHub’s history instead of merging.
=========================================

git checkout main → switches to the main branch.

git checkout file.txt → restores file.txt to the last committed state.

-b --> Create a new branch with this name and switch to it immediately.

git branch update-commands   # create a new branch
git checkout update-commands # switch to that branch

git add → marks changes to be saved

git commit → saves changes in Git history

git push → uploads the changes to remote

=================
git clone "github path"

git checkout -b branchname (to switch to branch)
